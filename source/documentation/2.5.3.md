#### [2.5.3 Label in Name (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#label-in-name)

For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the [Accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name) contains the text that is presented visually.

##### Why is this a problem?

The ‘name’ is text by which software can identify a component within Web content to the user. The ‘Accessible Name’ is text in the DOM that is understood by both the AT (like a screen reader) and the browser. This is often hidden in code.

These need to match so that:

* Speech input users can activate controls on a page.
* Text-to-speech users will have a better experience because the labels that they hear match the visible text labels that they see on the screen.

##### What to do?

The accessible name can be the ‘label’ used on a form input. This can be provided by the label element in HTML or by an aria-label or similar. There are other ARIA and HTML elements that can provide the accessible name for a component.

Ensure that the:

* <strong>Accessible name matches the visible label:</strong> The accessible name and visible label of a control match.
* <strong>Accessible name starts with visible label:</strong> The accessible name of a "Start here" button begins with the same text as the visible label.

##### Common Mistakes

* The Accessible name does not contain the visible label text 
* The Accessible name contains the visible label text, but the words of the visible label are not in the same order.
* The Accessible name contains the visible label text, but there are extra words in the label.
