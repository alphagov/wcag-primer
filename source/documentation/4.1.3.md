#### [4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#status-messages)

There are different situations where a Status messages needs to be shown in a way that the AT understands. These these messages need to be presented without receiving focus themselves or disturbing the users place in a page. 

##### Why is this a problem?

* A sighted person can quickly see status messages on a page, and them go back to what they were doing or reading. Moving focus to a message can be disruptive for screen reader users, users of speech recognition software and keyboard only users.
* If focus is always moved to the message users with cognitive impairments may also be confused by unpredictable focus changes. 


##### What to do?

The following are different situations where you will need to cover.

###### When a status message tells the user something is successful

When a status message tells the user something is successful or is the results of an action. This can also be used for a state change when part of a page updates:

You can use these following techniques:

[Use the ARIA role=status to present status messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA22) in combination with the technique [Providing success feedback when data is submitted successfully](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G199).

###### If a status message conveys a suggestion, or a warning or error:

<strong>NOTE:</strong> There may be time when you do want to move focus to a message, such as an error, as a part of form validation etc.

Use the following techniques:

[Use ARIA role=alert or Live Regions to Identify Errors](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA19) in combination with any of the following:
* [Providing text descriptions to identify required fields that were not completed](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G83)
* [Providing a text description when the user provides information that is not in the list of allowed values](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G84)
* [Providing a text description when user input falls outside the required format or values](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G85)
* [Creating a mechanism that allows users to jump to errors](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G139)
* [Providing suggested correction text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G177)
* [Providing spell checking and suggestions for text input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G194)

###### If a status message conveys information on the progress of a process:

The ARIA role="progressbar" can be used but may not be enough on its own (depending on AT and browser support). For some examples of progressbar role see:

[Mozilla - Using the progressbar role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_progressbar_role)
[ARIA Progress bar example - LevelAccess Labs](https://labs.levelaccess.com/index.php/ARIA_Progressbar)

You can use the following techniques:
* [Using role=log to identify sequential information updates](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA23)
* [Using role=status to present status messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA22) in combination with [Providing help by an assistant in the Web page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G193)


##### Common Mistakes
* Status messages are not to be shown in a way that the AT understands or receive focus.
* Using role="alert" or aria-live="assertive" on content which is not important.
* On a page with ARIA live regions - if regions are hidden or not needed - always make sure to switch their active and inactive states accordingly.



##### Common Mistakes

* Functionality that can only be activated via device motion events (e.g., shaking or tilting)
* The user is unable to disable motion actuation.
* The author has turned off system level features which allow the user to disable motion actuation.
