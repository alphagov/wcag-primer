#### [2.2.1 Timing adjustable (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-required-behaviors.html)

When a time limit like a session timeout is set, it must be possible for the user to turn it off, delay it, or extend the length of time. This ensures that people who need longer to complete tasks because of cognitive or mobility impairments, are able to do so comfortably.

##### Requirements

*   A mechanism is available to let users turn off, delay or extend time limits.

##### Common issues

*   A time limit is set, but a user is unable to turn it off, delay it, or extend it;
*   A time limit warning is displayed, but a user’s attention is not drawn to it in an appropriate way.

##### Useful resources
