# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Government Digital Service is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This accessibility statement applies to the guide to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) on [alphagov.github.io/guide-to-wcag](./).

## How accessible this website is

Although we believe this website meets the legal standard, we know some parts of this website are not fully accessible. In particular:

* users of speech recognition software may find it difficult to scroll through the side menu
* some content such as the Crown Copyright image may not display well when using a high contrast mode

We have identified some other issues which we believe fall outside of WCAG AA. These are listed on our [issues page](https://github.com/alphagov/guide-to-wcag/issues) and we are working to fix them.

## Compliance status

This website is fully compliant with the WCAG version 2.2 AA standard.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 10 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 25 July 2025.

A manual and automated accessibility audit was carried out in January 2025, testing the following representative pages for all WCAG 2.2 AA criteria:

* [Guide to WCAG home page (Getting started)](/)
* [Accessibility statement for the guide to WCAG](/accessibility.html)
* [3.1.1 Language of Page (A)](/sc/3.1.1.html)
* [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A)](/sc/4.1.2.html)
* [Community](/community.html)

Testing was carried out on both Mac and Windows machines. The tools we used for testing included:

* Chrome and Safari browsers
* VoiceOver on Mac
* VoiceControl on Mac
* JAWS on Windows
* NVDA on Windows
* Dragon on Windows
* Windows High Contrast Mode

This audit identified several issues. All WCAG AA issues from this audit were fixed, and a further, brief manual and automated accessibility check was carried out in June 2025.
