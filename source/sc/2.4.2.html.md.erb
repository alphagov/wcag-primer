[Understanding <%= current_page.data.title %>](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled.html)

Each page must have a unique title that indicates its topic or purpose. This ensures that people with cognitive disabilities can quickly orientate themselves within the service and identify the purpose of the page without interpreting its entire contents.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   Each page has a title that is unique within the service;
*   Each page has a title that indicates its topic or purpose.

## Common mistakes

*   The page title is not unique within the service;
*   The page title does not indicate its topic or purpose;
*   The title does not indicate the page is part of a service on Gov.UK;
*   The page title does not change because the service is a Single Page Application (SPA).
