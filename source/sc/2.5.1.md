#### [2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pointer-gestures)

On mobile devices where you can use a touch - and need more than one finger or need to follow a path type gesture, functionality can still be operated using a single pointer.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> This is true unless multi point or path based gestures are essential.

##### Why is this a problem?

Some disabled users may need simple inputs or gestures to complete tasks and make selections. Complex movement or gestures requiring dexterity or accuracy may be hard for them. 

###### What is a path-based gesture?
If an interaction is not just the end-to-end part but important but also the road or path taken.  These gestures could be swiping, dragging items or drawing. 

##### What is a multi-point gesture?
This can be zooming into content using a ‘pinch’ type motion with two fingers, a swipe with multiple fingers and so on.

##### Requirements / What to do?

Design your interface so controls and content can be used without these path or multi-point gestures. 

<strong>Single point activation</strong> is like it sounds. This means ensuring that on a touchscreen or touchpad users will be able to do everything using only taps, double taps, and long presses. 

For a mouse, trackpad, head-pointer, or similar device include single clicks, click-and-hold and double clicks.

Some examples are:

* In a map where you can pinch gesture to zoom the zooming can be done via [+] and [-] buttons.
* In a Carousel with a horizontal content slider, hidden content can be moved into the viewport with swiping or forward and backward arrow buttons to navigate instead.
* Do not rely only on path-based gestures.
* Do not rely only on multi-point gestures.

##### Common mistakes

* Requiring complex gestures to do things.
* Functionality can be operated by pointer input but not with single-point activation alone.
