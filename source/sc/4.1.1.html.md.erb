# <%= current_page.data.title %>

[Understanding <%= current_page.data.title %>](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing.html)

The code of the page must not cause browser or assistive technology conflicts. This ensures that content and functionality is presented in a way that works reliably across all supported browsers and assistive technologies.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   HTML code must conform to the standard identified in the doctype statement;
*   ARIA code must conform to the rules for use with the host language (HTML).

## Common mistakes

*   HTML elements are not well formed (opened and closed properly);
*   HTML elements include invalid attributes;
*   HTML id attributes use duplicate values within the same page;
*   ARIA attributes are invalid.

## Useful resources

*   [W3C conformance validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
