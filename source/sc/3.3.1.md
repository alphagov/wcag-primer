#### [3.3.1 Error identification (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-identified.html)

When an error occurs the user is informed what caused the error, and the error is described in text. This ensures that the error is available to people who cannot see, distinguish colours, or understand icons and other visual cues.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   Each error is described in text;
*   Each error is associated with the field it relates to;
*   Multiple errors are summarised at the top of the form.

##### Common mistakes

*   An error is only indicated by a red border around the field;
*   An error is only indicated by an icon near to the field;
*   An error is described in text, but it is not associated with the field it relates to;
*   Multiple errors occur, but no summary is provided.
*   An error summary is provided, but keyboard focus is not taken to it.
