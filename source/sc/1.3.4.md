#### [1.3.4 Orientation (A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html)

A page view must not be locked to either horizontal or vertical views only, unless this is essential.  ‘Essential’ orientation may considered to be in a messaging app, or when making music using a piano type application, viewing slides for a projector show, television or virtual reality content.

##### Why is this a problem?

Users with low-vision should be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them, due to the need for increased text size. For users with dexterity impairments, who mount a mobile device or tablet, they will need to see content in their preferred way. 

##### Requirements / What to do?

* Each page should be viewed in an orientation that suits the user. Use CSS to allow both landscape and portrait.
* Users with low-vision should be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them.
* Users with low-vision should be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them, due to the need for increased text size and users with dexterity impairments, who mount a mobile device or tablet, will be able to use the content in their preferred way.
* Use show/hide controls to allow access to content in different orientations.

##### Common mistakes

* Locking the orientation of the device so it is set in one way only, and does not adapt.
