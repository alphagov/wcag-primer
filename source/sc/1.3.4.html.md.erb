title: 1.3.4 Orientation (A)

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## What WCAG says:

> Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.

[Understanding 1.3.4 Orientation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/orientation)

## What this means

User interfaces should be usable in portrait or landscape orientation.

## Why it matters

Users with low vision should be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them. Landscape orientation allows for text to appear larger whilst remaining readable. 

For users with dexterity impairments who fix a mobile device or tablet in one position, they will need to see content in their preferred way. Some user interface features, such as the on-screen keyboard, may also provide larger buttons in landscape orientation.

## How to check

Using a device with an orientation sensor, such as a tablet or smartphone, make sure that content remains readable and user interface controls remain usable in both portrait and landscape. You should not be prompted to change the orientation.

## Good example

### App layout adjusts to the device

<%= image_tag "../images/134/134-pass-orientation.png", { :alt => 'A game store app on smartphones in both portrait and landscape. The content on the landscape phone has been rotated and expanded to fit the orientation.' } %>

This passes because the app's layout is adjusted to match the device's orientation, without removing or restricting access to the content.

## Common mistakes

### Restricting content to a single orientation

<%= image_tag "../images/134/134-fail-orientation-restricted.png", { :alt => 'A word game on smartphones in both portrait and landscape. The portrait phone shows the game as normal, but the landscape phone shows an instruction telling the user to rotate their device.' } %>

This fails because the webpage only allows access to the content in portrait orientation. Landscape orientation instead shows a message instructing the user to rotate their device to portrait.

### Content not adjusting to landscape mode

<%= image_tag "../images/134/134-fail-orientation-no-rotate.png", { :alt => 'An app store on smartphones in both portrait and landscape. The store has not rotated for the landscape phone, with the content displayed sideways.' } %>

This fails because the app's layout does not adjust to match the device's orientation, continuing to show portrait-oriented content on a landscape device.

## Related success criteria

To pass this success criterion, it's only important that the user is not forced to use a specific orientation. Ensuring that layouts adapt to changing orientations is partially covered by [1.4.10 Reflow](1.4.10.html).
