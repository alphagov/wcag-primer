# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## What WCAG says:

> More than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages except where the Web Page is the result of, or a step in, a process.

## What this means

Users can locate and navigate content easily, quickly and in a way that works best for them.

## Why it matters

Users have different needs and different preferences. For example, someone with a cognitive disability may use a sitemap to locate content, or someone with a visual impairment may use a search function instead of scrolling through a large page of content.

## How to check

Look for at least 2 ways to navigate to all pages that are not part of a process. All navigation methods must work and be easy to find.

The most common navigation tools to check are:

* breadcrumbs or sub-navigation that usually appears at the top of a page
* a sitemap â€“ a page with links to all pages counts as a sitemap, as well as links in the footer
* search functionality, allowing you to search for the page name or content within

## Good example

### Page appears in search results

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/245/245-pass-search-result.png", { :alt => 'Search result' } %>
    <figcaption>A search field for "accessibility statement for pay by card" followed by a relevant search result.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Common mistakes

Common mistakes include:

* There are pages that are not part of the navigation structure.
* A second navigation structure (like a sitemap or a search) is not present or easy to find.
* Navigation methods do not work correctly - for example, some pages do not appear in search results

### Dead link in search results

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/245/245-fail-dead-link.png", { :alt => 'Dead link' } %>
    <figcaption>A search field for "accessibility statement for pay by card" followed by a "this link is dead" message.</figcaption>
</figure>
