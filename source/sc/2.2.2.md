#### [2.2.2 Pause, stop, hide (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html)

When content moves (is animated, blinks or scrolls) automatically for more than five seconds, or when content automatically updates on the page, it must be possible for users to pause, stop or hide it. This ensures that people with cognitive disabilities that affect focus and concentration, are not distracted by movement.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   A mechanism is available that lets users pause, stop or hide the moving or updating content;
*   Content does not move (animate, blink or scroll) for more than five seconds;
*   Content does not update automatically.
