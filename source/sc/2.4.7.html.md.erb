# <%= current_page.data.title %>

[Understanding <%= current_page.data.title %>](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html)

It must be easy to tell which element has keyboard focus. This helps sighted keyboard users orient themselves within the page, and confidently interact with it.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   Interactive elements like links, buttons, and form fields, have a visible focus indicator.

## Common mistakes

*   The browser default focus indicator has not been replaced with something that is easier to see;
*   An indicator has been provided for mouse hover, but not duplicated for keyboard focus.

## Useful resources

*   TBC.
