# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## What WCAG says

> Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

## What this means

Colour must not be the only thing used to tell different content apart.

## Why it matters

Not everyone can easily tell the difference between colours, such as people with a visual impairment, using assistive technology or with certain screen settings.

## How to check

Check that:

* Information is just as understandable in greyscale as it is in colour.
* Colour alone is not used to identify an object or text - for example, links should be underlined as well as using colour.
* Information graphics and charts that use colour as a key also provide non-colour differences, such as applying patterns or labels.

## Good example

### Indicating status using words

A 'set password' field uses words to show which requirements are met:

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/141/141-pass-colour-password-requirements-with-words.jpg", { :alt => 'Password requirements with words' } %>
    <figcaption>A field used for setting a password includes four requirements that the password must meet. While these are marked in red and green to show which are met, there is also a word “Pass” or “Fail” next to each requirement.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Common mistakes

### Colour is used to convey success or failure

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/141/141-fail-colour-password-requirements.png", { :alt => 'Password requirements in red or green' } %>
    <figcaption>In this example, the green text indicates the password requirement has passed and the red indicates the password does not meet that requirement.</figcaption>
</figure>

In general, the following examples fail:

* A form uses only colour to indicate a required field.
* Using coloured text or backgrounds for essential information, such as a pass or fail.     
* Links are only different from plain text by colour, with no other visual differences.     

## Related success criteria

* [1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](1.4.3.html) makes sure that text has enough contrast, regardless of whether it relies on colour to distinguish it.
* [1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](1.4.11.html) makes sure that components have enough contrast to be visible, regardless of whether they are distinguishable using colour. This can apply to icons, form fields or keyboard focus indicators.
