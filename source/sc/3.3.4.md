#### [3.3.4 Error prevention (legal, financial, data) (AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-reversible.html)

When completion of a form causes a legal commitment, triggers a financial transaction, or gives consent for personal data to be updated or changed, the user must be able to review, correct, and confirm that the information they have entered is correct, or they must be able to reverse the decision. This provides safeguards to prevent people with disabilities, and indeed all users, from making avoidable mistakes.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   When data is submitted leading to a legal commitment, financial transaction, or an update to personal data, an interim page, alert or status message is presented that allows the user to review, correct, and confirm the information they have entered.

##### Common mistakes

*   An online shop where order or personal details are not displayed so the user can confirm them or make changes.
