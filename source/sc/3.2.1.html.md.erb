[Understanding <%= current_page.data.title %>](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-focus.html)

When a keyboard user focuses on a control it must not cause a change of context, such as loading a new page/tab. This stops unexpected things happening without screen reader and screen magnifer users being aware of it.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   `focus` events do not cause navigation, nor form submission
*   components that respond to `focus` do not initiate a “focus trap”, where it is impossible or unclear how to navigate out of the component using the keyboard.

## Common mistakes

*   Dropdown menus trigger navigation as the user tabs between options
*   Javascript triggers navigation when a user is merely leaving a form control
*   focus is moved by script in ways that surprise the user
