#### [2.4.1 Bypass blocks (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html)

When there is repeated content (like a header) at the top of the page, there must be a way for keyboard users to move focus directly to the start of the main content area of the page. This ensures that people who do not use a mouse can quickly and easily reach the primary content of the page.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   A “Skip to main content” link is provided, and the link is located close to the start of the page;
*   The `<main>` element is used to represent the main content area of the page.

##### Common mistakes

*   The `<main>` element has been used, but there is no skip link that points to it;
*   A skip link has been provided, but it does not work in all supported browsers;
*   A skip link is provided, but it is only available to screen reader users.

##### Useful resources

*   TBC
