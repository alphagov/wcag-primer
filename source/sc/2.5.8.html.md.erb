title: 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA)

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Make sure clickable elements on a page are large enough for a user to easily select, and make sure they're not too close together. This is because people with physical impairments sometimes cannot click or tap small buttons that are close together.

## What WCAG says:

> "The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels…" (with exceptions)

[Understanding 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum)

## What this means

Interactive components such as buttons and links need to be either:

* 24 pixels high and 24 pixels wide, or
* spaced far enough apart

Their centres must be both:

* at least 24 pixels away from each other, and
* 12 pixels away from every other component

There are some exceptions to these rules, including when:

* there's an equivalent component that meets the rules elsewhere on the page
* two overlapping components do the same thing
* a component (such as a link) is in a line of text
* components (like radio buttons) have no custom formatting and use browser default styles
* more control is essential, for example on a colour picker

## Why it matters

This helps people who have difficulty with fine motor movement. If components are large enough or far enough apart, it reduces the risk of people clicking or tapping the wrong component.

## How to check

Some automated tools, such as [Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or [Steve Faulkner's Target Size Bookmarklet](https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/YzdwWZw), can detect many target size failures.

If you need to test manually, you will need to measure the pixels between the centres of each element. Ways to do this include:

* inspecting the elements in your browser's developer tools, to measure the size and margins of each component
* taking a screenshot and using an image editing tool to count pixels

## Good example

### Large enough pagination links

On the GOV.UK Design System, the [pagination component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/) has numbered links next to each other.

The clickable “hit area” of each link, pictured with the blue square, is 45 pixels high and 45 pixels wide.

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/258/258-pass-large-square.png", { :alt => 'Numbered pagination links. The number 2 is in a blue square, and there is a good amount of space between the number and the edge of the square.' } %>
</figure>

## Common mistakes

### Small links which are close together

On a set of A-Z pages, there is a row of links covering every letter of the alphabet.

When drawing a 24 pixel diameter circle at the centre of each link, there is a clear overlap between most circles, as the centres of each link are mostly under 24 pixels apart. The letter M is shown in green as it is the only link which is at least 24 pixels wide.

<%= image_tag "../images/258/258-fail-narrow-pagination.png", { :alt => 'The letters H to N in a row, each overlaid with circles. The circles all overlap each other except for the letter M.' } %>

This could be fixed by making each link at least 24 pixels wide.

## Related success criteria

To achieve AAA compliance and meet [2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-enhanced), every component should be at least 44 pixels high and 44 pixels wide.
