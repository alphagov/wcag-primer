# <%= current_page.data.title %>

[Understanding <%= current_page.data.title %>](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input.html)

Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behaviour before using the component.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   Users can predict what a control such as a button or drop-down menu will do
*   User interface components built with javascript have adequate and accurate ARIA labelling.

## Common mistakes

*   Controls built with javascript lack appropriate ARIA information
*   Form controls are used to trigger navigation without an explicit submit step, and without warning

## Useful resources

*   [Using ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/)
