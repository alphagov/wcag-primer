All content that is audio-only like a podcast, or video-only like a silent movie, must have a text description or an audio description. This ensures that information communicated for sight and sound is available to people who cannot see or hear.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   Audio only content that communicates information (like a podcast) has a text transcript;
*   Video-only content that communicates information (like a silent movie) has a text transcript that describes the video or a audio description.

## Common mistakes

*   Audio-only content that communicates information does not have a text transcript;
*   Video-only content that communicates information does not have a text transcript or an audio description;
*   The text transcript for audio-only content does not include all spoken dialogue and sound effects;
*   The text transcript for video-only content does not include descriptions of all important visual information;
*   The text transcript for audio-only or video-only content is not clearly labelled as such.
*   The audio description for video-only content does not include descriptions of all important visual information;
