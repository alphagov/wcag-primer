It must be possible to navigate through content in a way that makes sense. This ensures that content can be navigated in a logical way by screen reader users, keyboard users, and people who choose to use their own CSS style sheets.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   The visible focus order matches the DOM focus order.

## Common mistakes

*   The DOM order does not match the visual order because CSS properties like flexbox and grid-layout have been used to alter the visual presentation;
*   When CSS styles are disabled, the focus order is meaningless;
*   When a user interaction causes content to be displayed, it does so before the trigger control in the DOM order.
