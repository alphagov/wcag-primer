#### [1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html)

In an text input form the purpose of each input field that collects information about the user can be understood by Assistive Technologies and browsers, when:
The input field serves a purpose that relates to the user of the content.
The content is created using HTML or supported by a language which can identify the expected meaning.


##### Why is this a problem?

* People with language and memory problems or disabilities benefit from the browser auto-filling their information.
* People with motor impairments also benefit from not having to fill in forms with the same information when the browser can do it for them.


##### Requirements / What to do?

* A form may be written in a way where its purpose or the purpose of some of the components is not clear. This can be passed by using the
[HTML 5.2 autocomplete attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill), on fields that collect information about the user.  

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Remember that you only need to add Autocomplete attributes to inputs that collect <strong>information about the user</strong>.

##### Common mistakes

* Building a form that collects information about the user without the autocomplete (or other semantic that identifies the purpose of the input).



##### Useful resources

* Find out [how to use the HTML 5.2 autocomplete](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H98) attributes.
* An [example of a form using autocomplete](http://john.foliot.ca/demos/autofill.php) - (Thanks to John Foliot)

<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you view the example form using the browser inspection tools or ‘View Source’ you will see the autocomplete attributes added to the various form inputs that relate to the user.

```html
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<label for="1">Name</label>
<input type="text" name="1" id="1" autocomplete="name">
<label for="2">Honorific / Prefix</label>
<input type="text" name="2" id="2" autocomplete="honorific-prefix">
<label for="3">Given Name</label>
<input type="text" name="3" id="3" autocomplete="given-name">
