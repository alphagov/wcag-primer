[Understanding <%= current_page.data.title %>](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html)

It must be possible for someone using only a keyboard (or a device that emulates keyboard commands) to complete all tasks in a service. This ensures that people with mobility or dexterity impairments who do not use a mouse can successfully complete their goals.

## Requirements / What to do?

*   All interaction and functionality is usable with a keyboard.

## Common mistakes

*   A custom widget has been created, but the necessary keyboard support has not been provided;
*   An `<a>` element has been used as the basis for a button, but the additional keyboard interaction (activation with the space key) has not been provided;
*   A dialogue opens but cannot be dismissed by touch, because it does not have a close button;
*   The tabindex attribute has been used with a value of “-1” to mistakenly remove it from the tab order.
