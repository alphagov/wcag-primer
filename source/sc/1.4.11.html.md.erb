# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## What WCAG says:

> “The visual presentation of [user interface components and graphics] have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colours” (with exceptions)

[Understanding 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast)

## What this means

Important visual information that is not text (for example, form controls, icons and charts) needs a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with its surroundings. This applies unless:

* the style is a default for the browser or device, or
* it is "essential" that the information is presented with low contrast

## Why it matters

People with visual impairments may not be able to see graphical information with poor contrast.

## What to check

Check that any important information not conveyed through text has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its surroundings.

For a colour generated using the page's code, the colour is likely to be findable using your browser's developer tools. Otherwise, colours can be checked using a colour picker tool such as [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/). It is best to test this criterion manually as it is not covered by most common automated test tools.

## Good example

The selected state of [radio buttons on the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/) uses a large black spot on a white background, making it very clear to see:

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/1411/1411-pass-radio-selected.png", { :alt => 'Selected radio button' } %>
    <figcaption>Four radio buttons showing UK countries. Wales is selected.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Common mistakes

### Low contrast form field

The following form field is difficult to see. A form field should be clearly identified by using a high contrast border or by having a different enough colour to its surroundings.

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/1411/1411-fail-low-contrast-search.png", { :alt => 'Search box' } %>
    <figcaption>A dark grey search field on a darker grey background.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Low contrast focus indicator

An orange focus indicator on a white page has insufficient contrast to be able to see it easily.

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/1411/1411-fail-low-contrast-focus.png", { :alt => 'Orange focus indicator' } %>
    <figcaption>Password field surrounded by an orange border on a white background.</figcaption>
</figure>

* [1.4.1 Use of Colour](1.4.1.html) covers elements being identified by colour alone.
* [1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](1.4.3.html) covers the contrast of text.
* [2.4.7 Focus Visible](2.4.7.html) covers focus indicators being visible, but 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast determines how visible they should be.
