#### [3.2.2 On Input (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change.html)

Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behaviour before using the component.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   Users can predict what a control such as a button or drop-down menu will do
*   User interface components built with javascript have adequate and accurate ARIA labelling.

##### Common mistakes

*   Controls built with javascript lack appropriate ARIA information
*   Form controls are used to trigger navigation without an explicit submit step, and without warning

##### Useful resources

*   [Using ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/)
