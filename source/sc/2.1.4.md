#### [2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#character-key-shortcuts)

If your webpage has keyboard shortcuts then one of the following must be true:
* <strong>Turn off:</strong> The user must be able to turn them off;
* <strong>Remap:</strong> The user must be able to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc);
* <strong>Active only on focus:</strong>The keyboard shortcut is only active when it has focus.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> This success criteria does not apply if you have not implemented keyboard shortcuts.

##### Why is this a problem?

* This can be a real problem for users of speech recognition software (like Dragon). Without the ability to turn off single-key shortcuts, they can be triggered accidentally and fire with the user wanting it to happen.

* Also Keyboard-only users who who may accidentally hit keys, or have involuntary movement will benefit from turning off single character shortcuts or modifying them.

##### Requirements / What to do?

Make sure your users have a way to turn off single-key shortcuts. This could be in a preference section of your site.

Or provide a way to allow users to change character-key shortcuts.  

The alternative shortcuts could be longer strings that would act as native speech commands for any speech engine. 

##### Common mistakes

* Not allowing the user to switch off or remap keyboard shortcuts.
