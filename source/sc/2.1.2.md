#### [2.1.2 No keyboard trap (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-trapping.html)

When someone using a keyboard to navigate content moves to an element, they must be able to move away from it again. This ensures that people who use a keyboard do not get stuck on any part of the page.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   Keyboard focus can move to an element and away again.

##### Common mistakes

*   A dialogue opens but cannot be closed with the keyboard, preventing the user from accessing the original content underneath;
*   Content is presented in an infinite scroll, so a keyboard user is forced to tab through everything before they can exit the scroll area.

##### Useful resources

*   TBC
