title: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (A)

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## What WCAG says:

> A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages.

[Understanding 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/bypass-blocks)

## What this means

When there is repeated content (like a header or a navigation menu with lots of links at the top of the page), there must be a way for keyboard users to move focus directly past that content.

## Why it matters

People who use assistive technology, such as screen readers or a keyboard to navigate through pages, should have a way to quickly skip over repeated content. This means they don't have to go through lots of menus or links before getting to the main part of the website with important content.

## How to check

### With a keyboard

Use the Tab key to navigate the page and check that a skip link (for example, a link at the top of the page that says 'Skip to main content') appears before any repeated content.

Check that activating the link moves the visual and keyboard focus past the repeated content.

### With a screen reader

Use commands to open a list of links and check that a working skip link is present on the page.

## Good example

### Working skip link

The following page has a skip link close to the start of the page.

This link moves the visual and keyboard focus to the main content area, skipping the navigation.

    <%= image_tag "../images/241/241-pass-skip-link.png", { :alt => '"Skip to main content" link in a yellow bar at the top of a GOV.UK Design System page' } %>
</figure>

## Common mistakes

* A page has a skip link but it does not work as intended.
* A page has no skip link, and no logical heading or landmark structure to work as a backup method.

[2.4.3 Focus Order](2.4.3.html) ensures that the focus order around the page is logical, to help users navigate predictably using a keyboard.
