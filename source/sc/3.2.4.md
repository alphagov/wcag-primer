#### [3.2.4 Consistent identification (AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality.html)

When features with the same functionality are used in multiple places, they must be identified in a consistent way. This helps screen reader users correctly identify the type and purpose of the functionality.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   An icon has the same alternative text wherever it is used;
*   Buttons for “Next”, “Previous”, and “Continue”, are labelled consistently wherever they are used;
*   Form fields with the same purpose are consistently labelled wherever they are used.

##### Common mistakes

*   An icon is used to denote a file download, but has a different alternate text whenever it is used;
*   A search facility is provided on every page, but the text field and button have different labels on each page.

##### Useful resources

*   TBC.
