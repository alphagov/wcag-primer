title: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (A)
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## WCAG says:

> "The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context" (with one exception)

[Understanding 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context)

## What this means

Every link must have text which describes its purpose within its immediate context. The text does not have to be visible, but it must be conveyed to assistive technologies.

## Why it matters

This makes sure that screen reader users can understand the purpose of links in their context, and that speech recognition users can target links accurately using voice commands.

## What to check

The accessible name is the name used by assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice control tools. To find the accessible name of each link, you can use:

* your browser's developer tools
* a screen reader

Check that each link describes the link's purpose. If the link text itself is not enough to understand the purpose, then also check its immediate context, such as the same paragraph, list item, table cell or an associated table header.

Automated tools such as Axe can detect links with no text, but they cannot determine whether link text is appropriate when it exists.

## Good example

### Links with unique accessible names

The following screenshot includes three "Change" links related to a fictional person's name, date of birth and customer reference.

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/244/244-pass-change-links.png", { :alt => 'Change links' } %>
    <figcaption>Personal details with links to change the user's name, date of birth or customer reference.</figcaption>
</figure>

As the word "Change" alone is not enough to describe the purpose of each link, additional text has been added for assistive technology users. For example, the first link has an accessible name of "Change name".

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/244/244-pass-change-links-properties.png", { :alt => 'Accessible name' } %>
    <figcaption>Developer tools showing the accessible name of 'Change name'</figcaption>
</figure>

## Common mistakes

### Links with no text

A link fails this criterion if it is an image with no associated text. In this example, the Twitter and Search icons are described as "Unlabeled" when using a screen reader.

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/244/244-fail-unlabelled-links.png", { :alt => 'Unlabelled icons' } %>
    <figcaption>Twitter and Search icons showing as unlabelled.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Links out of context

The following link has generic text of "Read more" and is not in the same paragraph as the wording leading up to it, meaning it has no immediate context.

<figure>
    <%= image_tag "../images/244/244-fail-read-more.png", { :alt => 'Generic button' } %>
    <figcaption>A "Read More" button after some text, with a gap in the middle.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Related success criteria

This success criterion specifically relates to links being descriptive.

* [1.1.1 Non-text Content](1.1.1.html) relates to images having alternative text. If a link only contains an image which fails Non-text Content, it is likely to fail 2.4.4 Link Purpose too.
* [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](2.4.6.html) relates to all types of elements having descriptive labels, not just links.
* [2.5.3 Label in Name](2.5.3.html) requires that the accessible name includes any text that's presented visually.
* [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](4.1.2.html) requires that links also have an appropriate role.
