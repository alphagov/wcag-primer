#### [3.2.3 Consistent navigation (AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html)

When ways to navigate content are repeated on multiple pages, they must be presented in a consistent manner. This makes it easier for people to learn how to navigate the service, and it enables people to develop strategies (like using screen reader shortcuts) for more efficient navigation.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   Navigation mechanisms are presented consistently wherever they are used.

##### Common mistakes

*   A main navigation block is used on multiple pages, but is located in a different place on each page;
*   A breadcrumb navigation is used on multiple pages, but is presented in a different format on each page.

##### Useful resources

*   TBC.
