# <%= link_to current_page.data.title, "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-spacing" %>

For regular HTML page content, no loss of content or functionality happens with some changes to line height, letter or word spacing.

## Why is this a problem?

* People with low vision may require increased space between lines, words, and letters are able to read text.
* People with dyslexia may increase space between lines, words, and letters to increase reading speed.
* White space between blocks of text can help people with cognitive disabilities comprehend sections of a page and call out boxes.
 
## Requirements / What to do?

You can use a browser plug in or directly edit typographic CSS on a page to change the styles so that:

* Line height (line spacing) is at least 1.5 times the font size;
* Spacing following paragraphs is at least 2 times the font size;
* Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
* Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

Make sure that all text fits within its containing box without being cut off or without overlapping other boxes.

## Common mistakes

*  Not allowing or restricting the user from overriding text style.
