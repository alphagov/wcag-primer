#### [1.1.1 Non-text content (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html)

All non-text content like images, charts, icons and infographics, must have an appropriate text equivalent. This ensures that information conveyed by non-text content is available to people who cannot see it, like screen reader users.

##### Requirements / What to do?

*   Images (like logos and icons) that communicate information have short text descriptions;
*   Editorial images that support the text around them have short descriptions;
*   Images (like infographics, charts and diagrams) that communicate complex information also have longer text descriptions within the same page;
*   Decorative images have empty text descriptions.

##### Common mistakes

*   The image communicates information but does not have a text description;
*   The text description does not communicate the same information as the image;
*   The image has a text description but, like a placeholder or file name, it does not communicate the information in the image;
*   The image has a text description that is an exact duplication of content elsewhere on the page.
