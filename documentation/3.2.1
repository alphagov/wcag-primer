<p>When a keyboard user focuses on a control it must not cause a change of context, such as loading a new page/tab. This stops unexpected things happening without screen reader and screen magnifer users being aware of it.</p>
<h5 id="requirements-what-to-do">Requirements / What to do?</h5>

<ul>
<li>  <code>focus</code> events do not cause navigation, nor form submission</li>
<li>  components that respond to <code>focus</code> do not initiate a “focus trap”, where it is impossible or unclear how to navigate out of the component using the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h5>

<ul>
<li>  Dropdown menus trigger navigation as the user tabs between options</li>
<li>  Javascript triggers navigation when a user is merely leaving a form control</li>
<li>  focus is moved by script in ways that surprise the user</li>
