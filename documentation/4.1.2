<h5 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h5>

<ul>
<li>  An <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element contains no text content, and so has no accessible name;</li>
<li>  A form field has no associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element, and so has no accessible name;</li>
<li>  A set of tabs is created using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, but ARIA has not been used to provide the <code>tablist</code>, <code>tab</code>, and <code>tabpanel</code> roles;</li>
<li>  An <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element has been used as the basis for a button, but the ARIA <code>button</code> role has not been applied;</li>
<li>  A button is used as the trigger to disclose content, but the <code>aria-expanded</code> attribute has not been used to communicate the disclosure componentâ€™s current state;</li>
<li>  A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> has been used as the basis for an interactive component, but ARIA has not been used to identify the purpose of the component (or its constituent parts).</li>
