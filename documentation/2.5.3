<p>For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name">Accessible name</a> contains the text that is presented visually.</p>
<h5 id="why-is-this-a-problem">Why is this a problem?</h5>
<p>The ‘name’ is text by which software can identify a component within Web content to the user. The ‘Accessible Name’ is text in the DOM that is understood by both the AT (like a screen reader) and the browser. This is often hidden in code.</p>
<p>These need to match so that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speech input users can activate controls on a page.</li>
<li>Text-to-speech users will have a better experience because the labels that they hear match the visible text labels that they see on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="requirements-what-to-do">Requirements / What to do?</h5>
<p>The accessible name can be the ‘label’ used on a form input. This can be provided by the label element in HTML or by an aria-label or similar. There are other ARIA and HTML elements that can provide the accessible name for a component.</p>
<p>Ensure that the:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accessible name matches the visible label:</strong> The accessible name and visible label of a control match.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible name starts with visible label:</strong> The accessible name of a &ldquo;Start here&rdquo; button begins with the same text as the visible label.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h5>

<ul>
<li>The Accessible name does not contain the visible label text </li>
<li>The Accessible name contains the visible label text, but the words of the visible label are not in the same order.</li>
<li>The Accessible name contains the visible label text, but there are extra words in the label.</li>
</ul>
