<p>The purpose of every link must be clear from its link text, or its link text plus associated content if assistive technologies recognise the association. This ensures that screen reader users can understand the purpose of links without reading nearby content, and that speech recognition users can target links accurately using voice commands.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Link text clearly indicates the purpose of the link;</li>
<li>  Multiple links that point to the same destination have the same link text;</li>
<li>  Links have accessible names.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="common-issues">Common issues</h5>
