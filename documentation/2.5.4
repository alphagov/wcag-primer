<p>In a page or on a mobile device functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by alternatives like buttons, links or other controls. There should be a way for disabling responding motion, unless the motion can operate in an accessible way or is essential</p>
<h5 id="why-is-this-a-problem">Why is this a problem?</h5>
<p>This Success Criterion helps people who may be unable to perform tilting, shaking, or gesturing to use an interface - or the device may be mounted. Fixing this will ensure users can still operate all functionality by other means.</p>

<p>Notice how most of these following example are just about common sense alternatives to using motion to do things on a mobile device.</p>

<ul>
<li>A user can’t hold and move the device to navigate content. A control exists to navigate also.</li>
<li>When inputting text - shaking a device shows a dialog where you can undo the text input. A cancel button next to the text field offers the same functionality.</li>
<li>A user can tilt a device to advance to the next or a previous page. Buttons or links are also provided to perform the same function.</li>
<li>A user can move the device to change the view of an image. A control is also available to do the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="requirements-what-to-do">Requirements / What to do?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Do not use the <code>devicemotion</code> event to activate content functionality.</li>
<li>Ensure that alternative means of input exist when using device motion sensor input.</li>
<li>Provide a user preference to disable motion actuation.</li>
<li>Support OS features which allow the user to disable motion actuation.</li>
<li>Use the new <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS declaration. This will detect if the user would like to reduce animation or motion on the pages they visit.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Functionality that can only be activated via device motion events (e.g., shaking or tilting)</li>
<li>The user is unable to disable motion actuation.</li>
<li>The author has turned off system level features which allow the user to disable motion actuation.</li>
