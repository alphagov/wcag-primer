<p>If your webpage has keyboard shortcuts then one of the following must be true:
* <strong>Turn off:</strong> The user must be able to turn them off;
* <strong>Remap:</strong> The user must be able to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc);
* <strong>Active only on focus:</strong>The keyboard shortcut is only active when it has focus.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This success criteria does not apply if you have not implemented keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<h5 id="why-is-this-a-problem">Why is this a problem?</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>This can be a real problem for users of speech recognition software (like Dragon). Without the ability to turn off single-key shortcuts, they can be triggered accidentally and fire with the user wanting it to happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Also Keyboard-only users who who may accidentally hit keys, or have involuntary movement will benefit from turning off single character shortcuts or modifying them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="requirements-what-to-do">Requirements / What to do?</h5>
<p>Make sure your users have a way to turn off single-key shortcuts. This could be in a preference section of your site.</p>
<p>Or provide a way to allow users to change character-key shortcuts.</p>
<p>The alternative shortcuts could be longer strings that would act as native speech commands for any speech engine.</p>
<h5 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h5>
