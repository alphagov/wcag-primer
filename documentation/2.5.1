<h4 id="2-5-1-pointer-gestures-a"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pointer-gestures">2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)</a></h4>
<p>On mobile devices where you can use a touch - and need more than one finger or need to follow a path type gesture, functionality can still be operated using a single pointer.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is true unless multi point or path based gestures are essential.</p>
<h5 id="why-is-this-a-problem">Why is this a problem?</h5>
<p>Some disabled users may need simple inputs or gestures to complete tasks and make selections. Complex movement or gestures requiring dexterity or accuracy may be hard for them. </p>
<h6 id="what-is-a-path-based-gesture">What is a path-based gesture?</h6>
<p>If an interaction is not just the end-to-end part but important but also the road or path taken.  These gestures could be swiping, dragging items or drawing. </p>
<h5 id="what-is-a-multi-point-gesture">What is a multi-point gesture?</h5>
<p>This can be zooming into content using a ‘pinch’ type motion with two fingers, a swipe with multiple fingers and so on.</p>
<h5 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h5>
<p>Design your interface so controls and content can be used without these path or multi-point gestures. </p>

<p><strong>Single point activation</strong> is like it sounds. This means ensuring that on a touchscreen or touchpad users will be able to do everything using only taps, double taps, and long presses. </p>

<p>For a mouse, trackpad, head-pointer, or similar device include single clicks, click-and-hold and double clicks.</p>

<p>Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li>In a map where you can pinch gesture to zoom the zooming can be done via [+] and [-] buttons.</li>
<li>In a Carousel with a horizontal content slider, hidden content can be moved into the viewport with swiping or forward and backward arrow buttons to navigate instead.</li>
<li>Do not rely only on path-based gestures.</li>
<li>Do not rely only on multi-point gestures.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Requiring complex gestures to do things.</li>
<li>Functionality can be operated by pointer input but not with single-point activation alone.</li>
